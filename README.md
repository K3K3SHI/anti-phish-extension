Use two approaches to use the following file:

1>
Open Chrome and go to chrome://extensions/ in the address bar.

Enable "Developer mode" (toggle in the top right corner).

Drag and drop the .crx file onto the Extensions page.

If prompted, click "Add Extension" to install.


2>

If Chrome blocks the installation:

Extract the .crx file (it's a ZIP archive) using tools like 7-Zip or by renaming it to .zip and extracting it.

In chrome://extensions/, click "Load unpacked", then select the extracted folder.
